# Finitine Volume Functions for heat trasnfer problems

This repository hosts functions used for solving 1D and 2D heat trasnfer problems from the text book "[An Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics 
the Finite Volume Method](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Computational_Fluid_D.html?id=NbYmEAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)" by Versteeg, H.K. and Malalasekera, W. (1995) .
